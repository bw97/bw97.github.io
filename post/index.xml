Sometimes my performance is far from good. Terrible, I mean.
However, this won&amp;rsquo;t prevent me from sharing my practice to maintain performance. I think it is helpful. My practice includes keeping work log and self assessment.
Work log Make a DONE list for everyday. Be brief.
Self assessment How did I do today? Rate today&amp;rsquo;s work on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the most productive/constructive/fruitful, and 1 the least.</description></item><item><title>A Quick Update</title><link>https://wzso.github.io/post/a-quick-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 20:25:09 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wzso.github.io/post/a-quick-update/</guid><description>Obviously I failed to write here regularly. Got a job in a fortune 500 company in June. Relocated to a new city. Work-life balance, finally. We&amp;rsquo;re given the freedom to work from home for most of the time. So it is even better than what I&amp;rsquo;ve expected before. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at home for almost a month. It feels great to be able to spend so much time with famaily.

I had my first IELTS test last month. Here is the result:
Listening Reading Writing Speaking 7.5 8 6 5 So, writing and speaking are my weak points. This time I hadn&amp;rsquo;t spended much time preparing for writing and speaking tests. Actually, 6 is beyond my expectation. My expectation for writing was 4~5 before I handed in the answer sheets.</description></item><item><title>My First Post</title><link>https://wzso.github.io/post/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 19:34:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wzso.github.io/post/my-first-post/</guid><description>First of all, a resolution!

In this week, I took my third IELTS test. Results as below:

This time:

| Listening | Reading | Writing | Speaking | General |
| :-------: |:-------:| :------:| :------: | :------: |
| 6.5 | 8.5 | 6 | 6 | 7 |

The overall result is not as good a last time, but finally I got a minimum 6 in each band. Thank god. One less thing to worry about.

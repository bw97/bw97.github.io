In this week, I took my second IELTS test. I took it on computer this time. Results as below:

This time:

| Listening | Reading | Writing | Speaking | General |
| :-------: |:-------:| :------:| :------: | :------: |
| 9 | 8 | 6.5 | 5.5 | 7.5 |

Last time:

| Listening | Reading | Writing | Speaking | General |
| :-------: |:-------:| :------:| :------: | :------: |
| 7.5 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 6.5 |

The result is better than last time, but still not good enough in Speaking band. I need a minimum 6 in each band.

I'm gonna be honest. Sometimes my performance are far from good. Terrible, I mean.

However, this won't prevent me from sharing my practice to maintain performance. I think it is helpful. My practice includes keeping work log and self assessment.

## Work log

Make a DONE list for everyday. Be brief.

## Self assessment

How did I do today? Rate today's work on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the most productive/constructive/fruitful, and 1 the least.

Obviously I failed to write here regularly.

Got a job in a fortune 500 company in June. Relocated to a new city. Work-life balance, finally.

We're given the freedom to work from home for most of the time. So it is even better than what I've expected before. I've worked at home for almost a month. It feels great to be able to spend so much time with famaily.

It demands more self-descipline to work at home. I'm try to do better.

It'd be impossible if I hadn't tried to refresh English skills. That being said, my English still sucks, especially when it comes to speaking. More effort is still needed.

Just recently, I realised what great saying this is:

> Be strict with oneself and lenient towards others. 

> 严以律己，宽以待人。
